# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT : SOCIAL MEDIA SENTIMENT ANALYSIS 
# Objective :
- Analyze social media data to extract sentiment scores.  
- Preprocess the textual data for enhanced accuracy using NLP techniques.  
- Visualize sentiment trends over time for meaningful insights.


# Key Activities :
1. *Data Loading*: Import social media data into a DataFrame for analysis.  
2. *Data Cleaning*: Preprocess text by removing noise, such as special characters, URLs, and stopwords.  
3. *Sentiment Analysis*: Use NLP techniques and libraries like VADER to calculate sentiment scores for each post.  
4. *Visualization*: Generate sentiment trend charts and sentiment distribution plots.  
5. *Insights and Interpretation*: Derive actionable insights from the visualizations and trends.


# Technologies Used
- *Programming Language*: Python - The primary language for data processing, NLP, and visualization.


# Libraries and Tools
- *Data Manipulation*:  
  - *Pandas*: For loading, cleaning, and manipulating data.  
  - *NumPy*: For numerical computations and data transformations.  
- *Natural Language Processing (NLP)*:  
  - *NLTK* or *TextBlob*: For text preprocessing and sentiment analysis.  
  - *VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)*: For analyzing sentiment in short social media text.  
- *Visualization*:  
  - *Matplotlib*: For creating basic visualizations.  
  - *Seaborn*: For enhanced, aesthetically pleasing visualizations.  
- *Development Environment*:  
  - *Jupyter Notebook*: For interactive code execution and documentation.
